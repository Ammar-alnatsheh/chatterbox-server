# chatterbox-server
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

This assignment constitutes part II of your multi-sprint journey exploring client-server architecture. In part I, you built the chatterbox client-side app, and configured it to communicate with a remote Parse server that we had built for you. Today, you'll rip out the Parse server, and replace it with a local one you'll build using Node.js.

In this assignment, you'll use Node.js to implement a simple chat server. Users should be able to connect to your Node server with a web browser, choose a username, send messages, and see the messages sent by all the other users connected to the same server.

This sprint continues the trend of moving you into more autonomous problem solving. Expect that there are going to be many situations going forward through the curriculum where there is significant challenge in identifying what problem needs solving even before your work begins on how to solve it. Challenge yourself to be constructive in the face of unclear objectives and difficult-to-find solutions. Your ability to orient and work in unfamiliar environments with unfamiliar tools (especially poorly-documented tools) will be a pillar of your success as a software engineer.
